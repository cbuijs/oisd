Optimized version of OISD BlockLists

See original version here: https://oisd.nl/

Optimizations:

- Unduplicate and make domains inclusive of subdomains (remove redundant sub-domains)
- Make all domains lower-case
- Split IP-Addresses off into their own file (domains.ips)
- Filter out invalid (syntax) domains (domains.invalid)
- Filter out domains with non-existing IANA TLD (domains.invalid)
- Point out weird syntax domains (domains.weird)
- Suggested excludes (domains.exclude)
- Safe list, suggested excludes removed (domains.safe)
- Domains actually used according TOP-N lists (domains.top-n)
- Remove empty files
- All files ending in .routedns are in RouteDNS domains format
- All files ending in .rpz are in Response Policy Zone (RPZ) format

Lists used:

Small   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sjhgvr/oisd/main/domainswild2_small.txt
Big     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sjhgvr/oisd/main/domainswild2_big.txt
